# Hi AUDIT Consulting by TECHFUND

[**Hi AUDIT Consulting**](https://hiaudit.io/consulting) is a security audit service with high speed, high quality and best price.

1) **Performance-Based Fee Structure**  
TECHFUND's fee structure is based on performance, and the audit fee is determined based on the level and number of vulnerabilities. This is one of the features of our services.
　
2) **Audit experience supporting overseas expansion and stock exchange listings**  
TECHFUND has a wide range of experience in auditing projects prior to main-net launches and exchange listings, including experience in passing listing examinations on domestic and overseas exchanges and the ability to report on token outflows after main-net launches. We support our clients' overseas expansion and listing on exchanges by providing reliable reports in multiple languages. (Reports are available in English and Japanese upon request.)  

3) **Speed**  
TECHFUND provides speedy delivery in accordance with the volume of audits and the status of requests. We are also flexible in terms of delivery time.  
  
With these features, this service has received many repeat customers, with an average of 3.5 times per company.
In cases where we are asked to double-check with a major global security auditing firm, we have received high marks for being able to detect more serious problems and prevent more damage in advance, leading to repeat business.
If there is a budget limit, we can make proposals to maximize the effect according to the amount of the budget.
As a comparison to our audits, there is also the bug bounty method where we solicit suggestions from the public, but in cases where it is difficult to disclose the source code to the public, a bug bounty makes a white box audit impossible.  
  
Also, even if the system is submitted as a bug bounty, if the security of the system is low, many vulnerabilities will be detected, which may result in a loss of trust from the general public. In addition, there is a risk that a critical problem may be discovered in a bug bounty but not reported, leading to a separate attack.
From this perspective, it is important to eliminate as many system problems as possible in advance, which is why our audit services are used by our clients.　　  
  
TECHFUND, which has provided support for many new businesses, aims to further accelerate businesses by strengthening their "defense" so that they can focus on "offense" while they tend to focus only on innovation creation and business expansion.
